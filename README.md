# Word-or-Name-Generator
Makes new words, New Slang, Baby names, Brand Names, Business Names, Names
Stage Names, Book titles, and so on.
SO I couldn't get the website part to work right because I don't really know how to do it,
but the python code does run properly in the command line to make words. I also added the profanity/slur filter to it.
You have to install better profanity https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/
Also install flask, schedule, and tkinter to run the front file
You can use these files to make any kind of name or word from 5 to 7 letters long. I figure since I couldn't make the website work my self maybe
I can put it on here and someone else can make use of the files.
Also before running the front file add the index.html file to a folder called templates, place it in the same directory as the other python files the run the front file to see how bad my website is.
Pick up some of my art if you want to give support https://opensea.io/collection/squares-by-olzup
