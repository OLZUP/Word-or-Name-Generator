# Word-or-Name-Generator
Makes new words, New Slang, Baby names, Brand Names, Business Names, Names
Stage Names, Book titles, and so on.
SO I couldn't get the website part to work right because I don't really know how to do it,
but the python code does run properly in the command line to make words. I also added the profanity/slur filter to it.
You have to install better profanity https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/
Also install flask, schedule, and tkinter to run the front file
You can use these files to make any kind of name or word from 5 to 7 letters long. I figure since I couldn't make the website work my self maybe
I can put it on here and someone else can make use of the files.
Pick up some of my art if you want to give support https://opensea.io/collection/squares-by-olzup
